### Be the Brand

We all know that the best way to gain #followers on Twitter is with a #witty, catchy bio. But why write what you can aggregate? If BuzzFeed has taught us anything, it's that #content isn't about #quality, but #clickthroughs.

[Brandify](http://rubygems.org/gems/brandify) handles the hard work of thinking of a bio for you. Let it #synergize your thought leadership by crafting you a bio that's guaranteed to climb to the top of any #SEO #optimization #patterns you can #dream of.

You can generate your location, as well, if for some reason you don't know where you are. Find a hospital.

### Installation
Install it like you do any gem, either via the command line:
```
gem install brandify
```

or in your gemfile:
```
gem 'brandify'
```

### Usage
Invoke the #power of the bio with one simple command!
```
Brandify.bio #=> "Liberal. Hell. Hitler wonk. Anime dork. TV. IPA. Shrimp disliker. Step-cousin. Brand liker. Whiskey." 
```

Same with the location, which even gives you emojis:
```
Brandify.location => "Paris :fire: Boston :100:" 
```
